# AltWinMouseMove

AltWinMouseMove is a lightweight utility that brings a popular Linux Desktop Environment feature to Windows. By holding the Super-key (Windows-key + Alt) and click-dragging your mouse, you can easily move windows without relying on the traditional status bar. 

This program was created to address the challenges of smaller status bars and minimalistic application designs, allowing you to seamlessly reposition windows without the hassle of resizing from the edges.
